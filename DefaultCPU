- Hey there, I’m @DefaultCPU, currently a CSU Sacramento student in his final undergraduate year. Majoring Business Administration with a focus in Management in Systems.
- I’m interested in learning JS, React, Ruby, and HTML/CSS and learn to create projects in my field for my career.
- 📚 I’m currently learning on TOP and FreeCodeCamp, independently studying XCode for my Senior project.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any projects that will give me a chance to flex my coding skills, something at a beginner level, I need a possible mentor, or just a decent team that can help me along the process of understanding different languages.
- 📫 How to reach me: @Mestizwhoa on instagram, @BasuraDavid on twitter, https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidae/ for LinkedIn.
